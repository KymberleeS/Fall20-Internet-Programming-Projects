        <!--Introduction-->
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Kymberlee (or Kym) and I am 20 years old, turning 21 on September 1 (woohoo!). I am currently majoring
            in Computer Science with a minor in Math.
        </p>
        <!--Interesting Facts-->
        <p>
            I was born in the Philippines and attended school there until 1st grade. At 7 years old, my family moved to the United 
            States for my father's job. During the 3rd grade I started piano, and I've learned music extensively for 9 years after
            since then. It's funny how I ended up majoring in tech, especially with a musical background.
            <br><br>
            Some other facts about me is that I'm a workaholic (I need to have all my school work done before relaxing), I'm an 
            adrenaline junkie (love roller coasters!), and I'm a short person, only 5 ft tall.

        <p>
            When I'm not busy, I usually play a ton of video games with friends, especially with today's circumstances. It truly helps
            me relax and time really flies by while playing some games. Below is a picture of my gaming pc along with my 27 inch 
            monitor, clacky keyboard, and mouse. <br><br>

            If I'm not playing video games, I love hanging out with my friends. Our recent favorite activities is going through escape
            rooms. Our plan is to do every escape room here in Jacksonville! <br><br>

        <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
        <p>
            I was raised in an environment and culture where education is valuable and work ethic is important, and I couldn't agree
            more. I graduated high school from Paxon SAS and I am currently enrolled in University of North Florida pursuing my 
            Computer Science degree with a minor in Math, and I am projected to graduate in either Fall 2021 or Spring 2022.
            Additionally, I have done 3 internships with Citi, and I'm planning to intern with them a 4th time next Summer. For my
            early career, I am planning to land a Software Development role with them in the near future. I am very excited for my
            future plans and goals! <br><br>
            What I have earned/currently pursuing:
            <ul>
                <li id="bachelors">Bachelor's degree - Computer Science, Math (currently pursuing)</li>
                <li class="diploma">High School Diploma (earned)</li>
                <li class="diploma">IB Diploma (earned)</li>
            </ul>

                The IB Program is a rigorous 2 year academic curriculum offered in certain high schools.
